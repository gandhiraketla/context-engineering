# Context Engineering üß†

A repository for context engineering tools, agents, and storage mechanisms ‚Äî enabling more powerful and flexible context-aware AI workflows.


## Overview

‚ÄúContext Engineering‚Äù refers to the practice of designing, managing, and leveraging context (memory, environment, history) to improve AI agent behavior, prompt engineering, and decision-making.  
This repository provides modular components ‚Äî agents, storage backends, and utility tools ‚Äî to help you build context-aware systems.

## Strategies

This repo contains strategies to:

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Tool Loadout** ‚Äì Dynamically select only the tools the agent needs  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Context Quarantine** ‚Äì Isolate tasks in separate threads to avoid cross-talk  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Context Offloading** ‚Äì Store long-term memory outside the LLM context using [Zep memory](https://docs.getzep.com/)  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Context Pruning and Summarization** ‚Äì Compress conversation history without losing meaning  


## Architecture

The repo is organized into three primary components:

- **agents/** ‚Äî Agent implementations that can consume or produce contextual information  
- **storage/** ‚Äî Backends to store, retrieve, and manage context (e.g. embeddings, vector stores)  
- **tools/** ‚Äî Utilities for manipulating, cleaning, or querying stored context  

These components are loosely coupled so you can swap in your preferred storage or agent logic.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+  
- pip (or poetry if you prefer)  
- (Optional) API keys for embeddings/vector DBs if you use advanced storage

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/gandhiraketla/context-engineering.git
cd context-engineering

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
